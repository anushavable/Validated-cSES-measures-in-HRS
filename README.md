# Validated-cSES-measures-in-HRS
Includes all the code (SAS and Mplus) to create the validated measures of childhood socio-economic status presented in our Plos One (2017) paper: Validation of a theoretically motivated approach to measuring childhood socioeconomic circumstances in the Health and Retirement Study. 

We created 8 seperate files in this analysis: 6 files to create the measures (2 in SAS 4 in Mplus), 1 file to validate the measures (SAS), and 1 file to compare the measures to other comprehenisve operationalizations created from HRS data (1 file).  

File 01  (SAS)   cleans the variables that are used in social capital and financial capital exploratory factor analysis 

File 02  (SAS)   performs the human capital imputations 

File 03a (Mplus) performs the exploratory factor analysis for the social capital scale

File 03b (Mplus) performs the exploratory factor analysis for the financial capital scale 

File 04a (Mplus) performs the confirmatory factor analysis and imputations for the social capital scale 

File 04b (Mplus) performs the confirmatory factor analysis and imputations for the financial capital scale 

File 05  (SAS)   checks the reliability and validity for the created measures 

File 06  (SAS)   compares the validated measures to other comprehensive operationalizations used in HRS data
